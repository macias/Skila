It was
a cold grey day
in late November.
The
weather (pięć żółwi -- little utf-8 interruption) had changed overnight,
when a
backing wind brought a granite sky and a mizzling
rain
with
it,
and although it was
now only a little after two o'clock in
the afternoon the pallor of a winter evening seemed
to have
closed upon the hills,
cloaking them in mist.
Jamaica Inn by Daphne du Maurier



The
idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke.
It
rolls sullenly
in
slow
folds
from
the great chimneys
of the iron-foundries, and settles down in black,
slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves,
smoke on the dingy boats, on the yellow river--clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front,
the two faded poplars,
the faces of the passers-by.
